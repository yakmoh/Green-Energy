# Green-Energy
Green Energy is an open source solar energy system.

Solar energy is the cleanest and most available renewable energy source. The Modern technology can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including producing electricity, providing light and heating water for domestic, commercial or industrial application.

The aim of this repository is to design and construct an off grid solar energy system. The systen is broken into the following modules;
1. Oscillator Module: 
          (i). oscBoard Complited, this board has fully been tested on 12v battery system. 
              Testing on 24V system is ongoing. for more infomation please dowload the manual DOC.rar
          (ii). EGS002 proMAX 1 (atmega328P version) coming soon
          (iii). EGS002 proMAX  (stm32f103 version), this board has fully been tested on 12V and 24V battery system. 
     
2. Power Inverter Module: Tested.
3. Display Module: Testes.
4. Current Sensor Module: Tested.
5. Power Supply Module: Tested.
6. Solar Charge Controller Module: Coming soon.
